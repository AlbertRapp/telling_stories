# About the author {.unnumbered}

Rohan Alexander is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in Information and Statistical Sciences. He is also the assistant director of CANSSI Ontario, a senior fellow at Massey College, a faculty affiliate at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, and a co-lead of the Data Sciences Institute Thematic Program in Reproducibility. He holds a PhD in Economics from the Australian National University where he was supervised by John Tang (chair), Martine Mariotti, Tim Hatton, and Zach Ward.

His research investigates how we can develop workflows that improve the quality of data science. He is also particularly interested in exploring bias in data measurement and collection---whose data are systematically missing---and developing workflows and statistical models to adjust for that. 

He enjoys teaching and aims to help students from a wide range of backgrounds learn how to use data to tell convincing stories. He tries to develop students that are skilled not only in using statistical methods across various disciplines, but also appreciate their limitations, and think deeply about the broader contexts of their work. He teaches in both the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at both undergraduate and graduate levels. He is a RStudio Certified Tidyverse Trainer.

He is married to Monica Alexander and they have two children. He probably spends too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries. If you have any book recommendations of your own, then he would love to hear them.
