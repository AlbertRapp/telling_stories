Most people did not visit a doctor in the past week.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(AER)

data("DoctorVisits", package = "AER")

DoctorVisits %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = visits)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")
```

There were some people that visited a doctor once, and then very few people that visited two or more times.
